I've archived these scripts just in case I need to use them later. Feel free to use them!

Currently running Linux Mint 22 (Xia), and I'm having to follow the guides below in order to set this up. I've created this script to make the process easier.

You must apply execution permissions on the file, otherwise, it won't run, or you'll encounter errors!
When you execute any of the scripts, type "sudo [file location]." You can drag and drop the file instead of typing the entire file location.
